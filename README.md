# gardiner2unicode: Mapping Egyptian Hieroglyphs

A Python3.6+ package that 
* provides a convenient way to access the mapping 
of [Gardiner's Sign List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardiner%27s_sign_list) codes to unicode IDs;
* generates hieroglyphs as images.

A list of hieroglyphs was copied from 
[this Wikipedia template](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:List_of_hieroglyphs&action=edit).
